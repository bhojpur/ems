# Bhojpur EMS - Messaging System

The Bhojpur EMS is a realtime distributed event messaging platform-as-a-service used by the [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform) for application delivery. It promotes *distributed* and *decentralized* topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery
guarantee.

Operationally, **Bhojpur EMS** is easy to configure and deploy (all parameters are specified on the command
line and compiled binaries have no runtime dependencies). For maximum flexibility, it is agnostic to
data format (messages can be JSON, MsgPack, Protocol Buffers, or anything else).
